I’m a PhD student in the Carolina Health Informatics Program (CHIP) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My interdisciplinary research focuses on health data science, digital health, human-centered AI, and AI for health, with emphasis on large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, human–AI collaboration and alignment, data-driven clinical decision support, precision health and medicine, and mixed-method evaluation.

Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Michigan Medical School and the University of Michigan–Dearborn. I hold an M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor and a B.S. in Statistics & Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

**Research Interests**
- **AI for health:** retrieval-augmented generation (RAG); reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); NLP for clinical notes; personalized medicine and individualized care; multimodal models (text–image/tabular/omics); AI-assisted decision support (clinical & population health); AI reasoning, interpretability, and safety/privacy.  
- **Data science & digital health:** electronic health records (EHR); knowledge representation (knowledge graphs/bases); machine learning and model interpretability; mHealth; health literacy; health services and outcomes research; implementation and healthcare delivery.
- **Biostatistics & bioinformatics:** risk prediction and stratified management; survival and longitudinal modeling; causal inference; biomarker discovery and validation.
- **Evaluation & methods:** mixed methods research; user studies and human factors; reliability and robustness; validity and utility; ethics, bias, and fairness.
