I’m a PhD student in the Carolina Health Informatics Program (CHIP) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

My research focuses on biomedical and health informatics, data science, digital health, human–computer interaction, and AI for health, with emphasis on large language models (LLMs) in healthcare, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), human–AI collaboration and alignment, clinical decision support, and precision health and medicine.

Previously, I hold an M.S. in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor and a B.S. in Statistics & Mathematics from the University of Wisconsin–Madison.

**Research areas**
- **AI for health:** retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), NLP for clinical notes, AI-driven clinical decision support systems, and safety/privacy.  
- **Data science & digital health:** knowledge representation (knowledge graphs and knowledge bases).
- **Biostatistics & bioinformatics:** risk prediction and stratified management, cognition/behavior studies.
